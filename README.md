Smart Application for Energy Saving

This project was developed during a summer practice programme and focuses on building a web application called Smart Application for Energy Saving.

The main goal of the application is to allow users to monitor and manage the energy consumption of devices and equipment within the company in an efficient and intuitive way. By providing clear insights and control options, the app helps optimize resource usage and reduce energy costs.

Key Features

- Energy consumption visualization: View usage data on a daily and monthly basis to better understand patterns and identify saving opportunities;
- Device management: Add or remove devices from the database and schedule their operating times for optimized consumption;
- Savings tracking: Display the amount of energy saved daily and monthly, highlighting the impact of user decisions and encouraging responsible energy behavior;
- User-friendly interface: Simple, structured navigation across main modules: Login/Register, Home, Devices, Dashboard, and Profile.
